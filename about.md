PHR started out like any startup, with lots of opinionated conversation in the local watering hole that went too far and actually ended up as a business.

So here we are the 2 of us - **Colin Broderick** &amp; **Stephen Walsh** - starting out on our journey to revolutionise spatial research for elderly healthcare.

If you are interested in working with us, please do get in contact at [**info@phr.ie**](mailto:info@phr.ie)
