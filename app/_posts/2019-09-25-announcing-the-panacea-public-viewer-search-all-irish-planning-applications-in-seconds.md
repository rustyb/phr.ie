  Sourcing accurate and up to date planning information is a laborious process
  that requires manual searching of over 30 planning websites. PHR has designed
  a single website that brings together the planning information published by
  Local Authorities and An Bord Pleanala. For a small fee, comprehensive
  searches can be exported from the viewer. This is useful from a research
  perspective as well as for those whose job entails charting patterns of
  development across the State. The interface is intuitive and easy to use.
