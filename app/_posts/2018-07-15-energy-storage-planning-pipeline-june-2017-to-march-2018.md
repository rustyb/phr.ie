Since June 2017, at least 20 planning applications for energy storage projects have been submitted to local planning authorities across the Republic of Ireland. The majority of the applications submitted to date are located adjacent (or in close proximity) to existing substations. 

The planning status and distribution of the 20 planning applications is outlined below.

To date, Offaly County Council has granted planning permission for two one hundred megawatt (MW) energy storage projects. Both projects were submitted by Lumcloon Energy Limited. 

Energy storage can be facilitated through the use of a number of technologies. Energy storage is not a new energy technology in an Irish context, with the 292MW pumped-storage hydroelectricity plant at Turlough Hill in County Wicklow being the most noteworthy example.
