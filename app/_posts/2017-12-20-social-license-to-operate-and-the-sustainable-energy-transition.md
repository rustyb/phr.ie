  The deployment of renewable energy (RE) infrastructure, as a part of Ireland’s
  transition to a low carbon economy, has not been a seamless process as
  communities in the receiving environment frequently mobilise effective
  campaigns of opposition which impact the State’s obligations to decarbonise
  Ireland’s energy sources.

This paper explores the concept of ‘Social License to Operate’ (SLO) and the sustainable energy transition in an Irish context through the lens of the Irish planning system. The deployment of renewable energy (RE) infrastructure, as a part of Ireland’s transition to a low carbon economy, has not been a seamless process as communities in the receiving environment frequently mobilise effective campaigns of opposition which impact the State’s obligations to decarbonise Ireland’s energy sources. 

The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of ‘Social License to Operate’ and relate it to an Irish context by exploring societal acceptance of RE infrastructure as illustrated by community objections to this form of development. The renewable energy technologies (RETs) considered in this paper are wind and solar energy. 

These two technologies are currently at different maturity levels in Ireland, however, similarities in the manner in which they are perceived by communities have influenced the nature and characteristics of the permissions and infrastructure granted and developed to date. This paper will conclude with a number of recommendations as potential measures for the enhancement of community acceptance of RETS in an Irish context.
